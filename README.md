# Recipes-App

**Recipes-App is a web application developed as part of a group project during my studies at Trybe, specifically for the frontend module. The objective of this project was to create a website that resembles a recipe application, where users can view ingredients, cooking instructions, and more.**

This project was a collaborative effort, and I would like to acknowledge the my contributors for their valuable contributions!
